      \begin{itemize}
      \item Worked on AWS Relational Database Service
        \url{http://aws.amazon.com/rds/}.
      \item Develop and test features of the RDS system with three database engine brands (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server) on two operating system platforms (Linux, Windows).
      Being the key contributor for the second wave of RDS features in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), I designed, implemented and tested the Security Group feature for RDS in VPC.
      \item Built and maintained the distributed log analysis service that generates metrics to help evaluate the quality of service provided by RDS. It not only retrieves health data for all the RDS instances within each data center but also aggregates them to provide availability measurement for every single instance.
      \item Integrated Amazon Route53 (Cloud DNS provider) with RDS, which reduced ``Multi-AZ'' (RDS high availability feature) fail over time by more than 70\%. This work involves building a highly available and scalable health report service that leverages Route53's health check to achieve automatic DNS failover.
      \item Built extensive hands on knowledge with AWS technologies, including Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Work Flow, Simple Storage Service and Route 53
      \item Diagnose and fix problems in the system in real time, to ensure a seamless customer experience (``on-call'').

      Windows Azure Management and Runtime Team
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Worked on Windows Azure SDK Quality Assurance. Key responsibilities include building
      and maintaining Azure SDK’s test automation framework for both Desktop Tools and
      Cloud Runtime Library, providing partner team with tooling to facilitate End To End
      testing, and performing test sign off on software releases.
      \item Designed and built a regression test framework which condensed all Azure SDK features
      into 8 highly extensible and compact packages. Reduced the number of test packages by a
      factor of 10 without losing coverage.

      Windows Azure Developer Experience Team
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Developed the emulation tool to enable testing host-guest communication on a desktop
      Computer, using IIS Hostable Webcore and C++ to build a mock server and
      a C\# Wrapper to facilitate integration into existing test framework.
      \item Designed, implemented and tested the Key Management Service (KMS) proxy running in
      each Windows Azure Data Center worldwide. Using Windows Azure SDK to implement
      the Proxy Server as a service, which can be conﬁgured using DNS SRV record to point
      to diﬀerent KMS Server. The proxy also throttles activation requests from each IP address
      to prevent abusive usage of Azures KMS Activation Service. Wrote a full-ﬂedged C\# DNS
      Packet library from scratch.
